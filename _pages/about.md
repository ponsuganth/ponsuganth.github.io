Hello! I am a graduate student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, wherein I am pursuing a Master’s in Sustainable Design and Construction. I am presently concentrating in the Sustainable Urban Systems track and am excited to work on interdisciplinary solutions to sustainability challenges in the built environment. Before this, I completed an undergraduate degree in the Department of Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. In my senior year, I worked on two interesting problem statements related to sustainability in infrastructure systems as part of my Bachelor’s thesis. I was also a MITACS Globalink Research Intern in the Smart Cities Laboratory at the University of Western Ontario, London, over the summer of 2023. You can find more about my work in my CV here.

Beyond academics, I have been actively involved in initiatives addressing societal issues. I was one of the student heads of Debunk, India’s 1st student-run initiative against misinformation and fake news, which was a part of Shaastra 2023. I was also a part of Mind Trials, India’s 1st student-run initiative on Behavioral Science, which was a part of Shaastra 2022, wherein the objective was to use human behavior-inspired solutions to solve pressing societal challenges. We boosted the usage of restrooms from 83% to 100% among males in 2 villages in India using 7 behavioural nudges and implemented 4 behavioural nudges, increasing the usage of foot-over bridges by 32% by pedestrians on a busy street in India.

In my spare time, you can find me breaking my head over a cryptic crossword, or dancing in solitude to kuthu songs, or watching a good Tamil movie.
