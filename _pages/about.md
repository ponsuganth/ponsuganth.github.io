Hello! I am Ponsu, a graduate student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University, wherein I am pursuing a [Master’s in Sustainable Design and Construction](https://cee.stanford.edu/academics-admission/graduate-degrees/ms-programs/sustainable-design-construction-sdc). Before this, I completed an undergraduate degree in the Department of Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I am passionate about all things decarbonization in the built environment and aspire to be a leader in this space globally (my mom has always told me 'aim for the stars, land on the moon'). My skills lie in this realm of sustainability consulting for infrastructure - Net Zero Buildings, GHG Emissions Inventory Analysis, Energy Transition, Life Cycle Assessment, Power Systems Modelling, Sustainable Infrastructure Project Development, etc.

Currently, I am [Living Lab Fellow](https://sustainable.stanford.edu/sustainable-you/living-lab/student-positions/fellowships/) at the Office of Sustainability at Stanford, leading a high-impact project developing and institionalizing new processes to account for embodied carbon in the Stanford Project Delivery Process making a significant impact on the Scope 3 emissions inventory of the university. I am also a Research Assistant at the [Osman Lab](https://www.osman.science/people) using community-based participatory research methods to study water affordability issues. Recently, I also had the opportunity of intering at WSP with their [Built Ecology](https://www.wsp.com/en-us/services/built-ecology) team that offers sustainability consulting services in the city of dreams - New York. You can find more about my achievements and projects on this website!

Beyond academics, I have been actively involved in initiatives addressing societal issues. Most Recently, I was part of the philanthropy arm of the Leaders of the Built Environment (LBE) student organization at Stanford. Back home, I was one of the student heads of Debunk, India’s 1st student-run initiative against misinformation and fake news, which was a part of [Shaastra 2023](https://shaastra.org/). I was also a part of Mind Trials, India’s 1st student-run initiative on Behavioral Science, which was a part of Shaastra 2022, wherein the objective was to use human behavior-inspired solutions to solve pressing societal challenges. We boosted the usage of restrooms from 83% to 100% among males in 2 villages in India using [7 behavioural nudges](https://www.iitm.ac.in/happenings/press-releases-and-coverages/nudging-people-use-toilets-shaastra-waynudging-people-use) and implemented 4 behavioural nudges, increasing the usage of foot-over bridges by 32% by pedestrians on a busy street in India.

In my spare time, you can find me breaking my head over a cryptic crossword, or dancing in solitude to kuthu songs while cooking a new recipe, or watching a good movie([shameless plug to my letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/ponsuganth/)).
